to leverage the development environment:

1. install node.js.
2. clone the repo or download as a zip and extract it into a folder.
3. git bash into the directory and type the below commands:
  - npm install (this will install the local web-server)
  - bower install -g (this will install the front-end package manager)
  - bower install (this will install the local front-end packages)

if this is all done correctly, in the directory type
npm run dev (this will start up the local web server)

alternatievly, you can leverage CDN's to run the app in a production environment which will require editing the html to include publicly available js files.
